# Music Recommender system using PySpark

# Project Description

In current days, recommender systems are everywhere. For example, Amazon uses recommender systems to suggest some products that you might be interested in based on the products you've bought earlier or Spotify will suggest new tracks based on the songs you use to listen to every day. Most of these recommender systems use some algorithms which are based on Matrix factorization such as NMF( NON NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION) or ALS (Alternating Least Square).

So in this Project, we are going to use ALS Algorithm to create a Music Recommender system to suggest new tracks to different users based upon the songs they've been listening to.
